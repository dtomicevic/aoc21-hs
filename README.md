# Advent of Code 2021 in Haskell

Hey there! :wave: I wanted to refresh my Haskell skills so decided I would
attempt to solve the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)
tasks purely in Haskell. Check my code above and see how I've done.

## Run the Code

Each folder `day01`, `day02`, ... contains the solutions for the corresponding
day, both `part1.hs` and `part2.hs`. To compile the code, I use:

```
stack ghc -- part1.hs
```

Sometimes I also add the `-O2` optimization flag:

```
stack ghc -- -O2 part1.hs
```

## Do You Know a Better Solution?

I want to know! I'm not an expert in Haskell or algo problem solving. Please
tell me about it on Twitter [@dtomicevic](https://twitter.com/dtomicevic)!
